# Qoar_Data-Analyst_Project-Portfolio
This repository provides a curated overview of several projects I developed during my tenure at Qoar (January 2025 – 2026). The work showcased here represents a subset of my broader responsibilities, focusing on components that can be safely shared without exposing confidential company data.

Throughout my time at Qoar, my role involved a combination of project management tooling, data automation, scraping pipelines, analytics workflows, sentiment analysis, and the development of critical spreadsheet-based operational tools. Much of the work centered around integrating and processing data from project management systems to support reporting, performance tracking, and performance evaluation. Internal files, such as the manhour calculator and automated reporting spreadsheets, were essential to company operations but contain sensitive information and therefore cannot be published.

The materials included in this repository are:
* Web Scraping Scripts (generalized and redacted)
* Sentiment Analysis Experiments
* Meta Reporting Dashboard Flowchart
* A Performance Evaluation Flowchart 

All content has been sanitized to ensure no proprietary logic, internal data, or sensitive workflows are disclosed. This repository is intended to highlight my technical contributions while maintaining full compliance with Qoar’s confidentiality policies.
