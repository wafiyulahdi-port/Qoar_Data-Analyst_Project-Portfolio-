This folder contains a collection of scraping scripts designed to gather real-world competitor data from various online sources. The scraped data is then processed for sentiment analysis, forming an end-to-end pipeline that supports brand strategy, competitor monitoring, and market insight generation. The goal of this module is to automate data acquisition, clean the extracted text, and prepare it for downstream analytical tasks such as trend detection, sentiment scoring, and narrative mapping.

All examples in this folder are fully sanitized and free of confidential business information.
