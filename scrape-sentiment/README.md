This folder contains a collection of web scraping and sentiment-analysis utilities designed to gather and analyze competitor data for brand strategy development. The scripts focus on extracting publicly available information from various online sources, processing the text, and generating sentiment insights that can support strategic decision-making for clients.

Several internal files, particularly those tied to confidential sources, proprietary pipelines, or client-specific workflows, are not included to maintain data privacy and project confidentiality. Only generalized and share-safe components are provided.

The final output of this workflow is typically integrated into a Brand Strategy Report, where scraped data and sentiment results are combined with strategic analysis before being delivered to the client. The code in this folder demonstrates the structure of the scraping and sentiment process while ensuring that no protected information is exposed.
